# Releasing

How releases are versioned, signed, and published for Switchboard (Android & iOS).

## Versioning

The app version is calendar-based — **`YYYY.MM.PATCH`** (zero-padded month, e.g.
`2026.06.0`) — and lives in **one place**: `version.properties` at the repo root.

```properties
versionName=2026.06.0      # calver YYYY.MM.PATCH — bumped by the release workflow
versionCode=20260600       # packed from versionName; written by the same bump
backendTargetVersion=0.8.6 # LibreChat backend this build targets (best-tested)
```

- Year and month come from the current **UTC** date automatically when bumping; the only
  thing a release decides is patch-level vs release-candidate. PATCH resets to 0 when the
  month rolls over and increments for further releases within the same month.
- `AndroidApplicationConventionPlugin` reads `versionName` and **derives** `versionCode` as
  `YEAR*10000 + MONTH*100 + PATCH`: `2026.06.0` → `20260600`, `2026.06.1` → `20260601`.
  Monotonic as the date advances; limits are MONTH ≤ 99 (trivially true), PATCH ≤ 99.
  An `-rcN` suffix is stripped first, so a candidate and the stable it is promoted to
  share a versionCode.
- `version.properties` **also spells the code out**, and `scripts/bump-version.sh` writes both
  lines together — refusing the bump if the `versionCode=` line is missing. The derivation
  above stays authoritative: the plugin re-derives the code and **fails the build** if the
  literal disagrees, so the two cannot drift. The literal exists because F-Droid's update
  detection is regex-only and cannot evaluate the packing; without a number in a file it
  cannot see new releases at all. **The literal alone is not enough**: fdroidserver's default
  scan (`common.manifest_paths`) only reads `AndroidManifest.xml`, `build.gradle` and
  `build.gradle.kts` *under the app module*, so it never sees a root `version.properties`.
  Reaching it requires the fdroiddata recipe to say so explicitly:

  ```yaml
  UpdateCheckMode: Tags ^v[0-9]{4}\.[0-9]{2}\.[0-9]+$
  UpdateCheckData: version.properties|versionCode=(\d+)|version.properties|versionName=(.+)
  ```

  Without that field the app builds and publishes fine but is never offered as an update, so
  it belongs in the RFP alongside `Binaries` and `AllowedAPKSigningKeys`.

  The regex on `UpdateCheckMode` is load-bearing, not decoration. `Tags` takes an optional
  pattern, and candidates are tagged `vYYYY.MM.P-rcN` while the packing above **strips the
  `-rcN` suffix** — so `v2026.09.1-rc1` and `v2026.09.1` share versionCode `20260901`. The
  harm lands on whichever scan runs while only the candidate exists: it sets
  `CurrentVersionCode` from the rc, and every later scan sees the finalized release's *equal*
  code and treats the app as up to date, so the final is never offered. That first scan also
  writes a build pinned to the rc tag, and `Binaries:` then resolves to the rc's own APK —
  which exists, since candidates ship as GitHub pre-releases — so F-Droid would hand a release
  candidate to every stable user. The pattern is matched with `re.match`, which anchors only
  at the start, hence the explicit `$`.

  The full proposed recipe and RFP text live in [`fdroid/`](fdroid/).
- The About screen reads the *installed* version via `AppInfo` (package metadata), so it can never drift.
- This is the **app's** version and is intentionally independent of `backendTargetVersion`.
- `backendTargetVersion` is the **single source of truth** for the LibreChat backend the app
  targets. The app reads it via `BackendVersion.SUPPORTED_BACKEND_VERSION` (code-generated from
  this property by core/common's `generateBackendVersion` task), and `release.yml` reads the same
  key to add a **Target backend:** line to each release's notes. Edit the property — never the
  `SUPPORTED_BACKEND_VERSION` literal in `core/common/BackendVersion.kt` (it no longer exists as a literal).

Both platforms derive from the same `versionName`, so they stay in lockstep:

| Platform | versionName | versionCode | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| Android | `versionName` verbatim | derived YYYYMMPP | `AndroidApplicationConventionPlugin` reads `version.properties` at build |
| iOS | `CFBundleShortVersionString` | `CFBundleVersion` (same YYYYMMPP) | *Stamp Version* Xcode build phase reads `version.properties` at build |

> The "Stamp Version from version.properties" run-script phase runs after Info.plist is in
> the bundle and before codesign, so the committed `Info.plist` literals (and the unused
> `MARKETING_VERSION`/`CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` build settings) are just a fallback snapshot —
> the build always reflects `version.properties`. The same stamp drives the published iOS IPA
> (see *Cutting a release* below), so both platforms' assets carry the identical calver.

Bump it with the script (also run by the release workflow). For example, running in
June 2026 with stored version `2026.05.2`:

```bash
scripts/bump-version.sh patch   # 2026.05.2 -> 2026.06.0  (new month: PATCH resets)
scripts/bump-version.sh patch   # 2026.06.0 -> 2026.06.1  (same month: PATCH+1)
```

### Release candidates

To ship a candidate before a stable release, use the pre-release bumps:

```bash
scripts/bump-version.sh prepatch  # 2026.06.1     -> 2026.06.2-rc1  (start a candidate)
scripts/bump-version.sh rc        # 2026.06.2-rc1 -> 2026.06.2-rc2  (next candidate)
scripts/bump-version.sh finalize  # 2026.06.2-rc2 -> 2026.06.2      (promote to stable)
```

`prepatch` starts a candidate for the next patch version; `rc` advances the candidate
number; `finalize` drops the suffix to promote the current candidate. `rc` and `finalize`
never touch the version core: a candidate started in June and finalized in July still
ships as `2026.06.x` — the date reflects when the release train started. A hyphenated
version is published as a GitHub **pre-release**, which Obtainium skips unless the user
enables *Include prereleases*.

> The `-rcN` suffix is stripped when deriving the versionCode, so `2026.06.2-rc1`,
> `2026.06.2-rc2`, and the final `2026.06.2` all share one versionCode. Candidates install
> over each other fine, but if users update *from* a candidate *to* the final build, bump
> the patch instead of finalizing so the version visibly advances.

### Calver cutover

Versions before the calver switch were semver (`0.1.0` – `0.1.3`) under the same
versionCode packing (`0.1.3` → `103`), so codes stayed monotonic across the cutover
(`103` → first calver release's `YYYYMM00`). The jump is intentionally one-way: calver
codes are ~20M, so there is no path back to small semver codes without an epoch scheme.

## One-time signing key setup

Releases must be signed with **one permanent key**. If the key ever changes, every existing
user's update fails with a signature conflict and recovery requires uninstall + reinstall
(full data loss). There is no key reset for direct/sideloaded distribution.

1. **Generate the keystore** (do this once, keep it forever):

   ```bash
   keytool -genkeypair -v \
     -keystore librechat-release.jks \
     -alias librechat \
     -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -validity 10000 \
     -storetype PKCS12 \
     -dname "CN=LibreChat Mobile, O=LibreChat, C=US"
   ```

   > The `librechat` filename, alias, and dname above are historical — they record how the
   > existing release key was actually generated, before the app was renamed to Switchboard.
   > Do **not** "fix" them to match the new name: the dname is baked into the certificate, and
   > re-keying would make Android refuse the update for every existing install.

   Back it up in **2+ secure locations** (password manager / offline). Do **not** commit it
   (`.gitignore` already excludes `*.jks` and `keystore.properties`).

2. **Add GitHub repository secrets** (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions). Ideally put
   them in an Environment named `release` with required reviewers, so the release job is gated.

   | Secret | Value |
   |---|---|
   | `SIGNING_KEYSTORE_BASE64` | `openssl base64 -A < librechat-release.jks` |
   | `SIGNING_STORE_PASSWORD` | keystore password |
   | `SIGNING_KEY_PASSWORD` | key password |
   | `SIGNING_KEY_ALIAS` | `librechat` |

3. **Publish the certificate fingerprint** in the README so users can verify:

   ```bash
   keytool -list -v -keystore librechat-release.jks -alias librechat   # SHA-256 line
   ```

### Local signed builds (optional)

Create `keystore.properties` at the repo root (git-ignored):

```properties
storeFile=librechat-release.jks
storePassword=...
keyAlias=librechat
keyPassword=...
```

Then `./gradlew :app:assembleRelease` produces a signed APK. Without env vars or this file,
release builds fall back to the debug key so local builds and CI checks still work.

### Unsigned release builds

```bash
./gradlew :app:assembleRelease -PunsignedRelease
```

Produces `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-unsigned.apk` with no signature at all,
for packagers that apply their own. The flag outranks any credentials present, so it can be
tested without moving `keystore.properties` aside — and because the output filename changes,
the two builds can never be confused for one another. Note the "will be UNSIGNED" banner is
printed at configuration time, so a configuration-cache hit skips it; the filename is the
reliable signal.

This exists for F-Droid, whose buildserver has no credentials and would otherwise get a
release APK quietly signed with the committed *debug* key. Its build recipe requests the flag
with `gradleprops: [unsignedRelease]`. Nothing in the repo hardcodes that relationship — the
flag is just "build unsigned", equally usable by any downstream packager.

It is a hedge, not a requirement. fdroidserver does **not** insist on an unsigned build: its
`verify_apks` strips and ignores any signature found on the rebuilt APK, and
`AllowedAPKSigningKeys` is checked against the downloaded reference binary rather than the
rebuild. Building unsigned removes one variable from that comparison — which, under
`Binaries:`, is the step that publishes nothing at all when it fails. Do not restate this as
"F-Droid requires an unsigned APK"; it does not.

The release workflow exercises this path on every cut (see below), since nothing else does.
Ordinary CI deliberately does not: a release cut is the only time the unsigned build matters,
and that job already pays for one R8 run, so the check is nearly free there and would be a
second full shrink on every pull request.

## Cutting a release

> **Before dispatching:** add `fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/changelogs/<versionCode>.txt`
> for the version you are about to cut, and commit it to the branch first. Nothing in the
> workflow writes it, and F-Droid/IzzyOnDroid read the file **from the tagged commit** — the
> release commit contains only `version.properties`, so a changelog added afterwards is not
> reachable from the tag and never appears. The filename is the versionCode
> (`2026.08.4` → `20260804`), which `scripts/bump-version.sh` computes as
> `YEAR*10000 + MONTH*100 + PATCH` from today's UTC date; see `fastlane/README.md`.
>
> Because the date is read **at dispatch time**, a changelog written in advance goes stale if
> the cut slips into the next month: `patch` would yield `2026.10.0`/`20261000` where the file
> says `20260900`, and the release ships with no changelog at all. Nothing fails — re-check the
> filename against the bump you are about to run. The same applies to the version pins in
> [`fdroid/com.garfiec.librechat.yml`](fdroid/com.garfiec.librechat.yml).

1. Actions → **Release** → *Run workflow* → choose the bump (`patch` for a stable
   release, or `prepatch`/`rc`/`finalize` for the candidate flow). Year/month are
   derived from the current UTC date automatically.
2. The job bumps `version.properties`, commits and tags `vYYYY.MM.P` **locally**, builds a
   signed universal APK, **asserts it carries the published signing certificate**, re-verifies
   that the unsigned build path still works, signs a SLSA build-provenance attestation, and
   **only then pushes** the commit and tag and creates a **draft** GitHub Release with
   auto-generated notes and a `.sha256` checksum. Candidate versions are flagged as
   pre-releases automatically. If any step fails, nothing is pushed — the commit and tag exist
   only on the runner and die with it, so just re-run after fixing it.

   The tag is created *before* the build on purpose: `BuildConfig.GIT_SHA` is stamped from
   `git rev-parse HEAD` at build time, so building first shipped a binary carrying the SHA of
   the commit *preceding* its own tag. Rebuilding from the tag then produced a different string
   in the dex, which made the release impossible to reproduce byte-for-byte — a prerequisite for
   F-Droid publishing our developer-signed APK rather than re-signing with its own key.

   The certificate assertion compares against the fingerprint published in the README. It
   exists because a swapped or rotated keystore secret is otherwise undetectable here: the
   checksum, the attestation and the draft release would all faithfully describe a
   wrongly-signed binary, and Android refuses in-place updates across a key change, so every
   existing install would be stranded.
3. A **secondary `ios` job** (macOS runner) then checks out the freshly tagged commit, builds
   an **unsigned device IPA**, attests it, and attaches `switchboard-vX.ipa` + `.sha256` to the
   same draft. It uses **no secrets and no Apple account** (sideload installers re-sign on the
   user's device), so it needs nothing beyond the standard CI setup. It is **non-blocking**: if
   the macOS build fails the Android tag + APK + draft already stand — re-run just the `ios` job
   or attach the IPA by hand. The IPA may land a few minutes after the APK.
4. Review the draft, edit the notes for users, then **publish**.
5. Obtainium / IzzyOnDroid pick up the published release automatically (Android); iOS users
   sideload the IPA manually (see *Installing the iOS IPA* below).

> **Drafts are invisible to Obtainium.** A release stays hidden from every user until you
> click **Publish** — Obtainium's GitHub source skips drafts. The workflow ends with a
> warning annotation reminding you to publish; don't skip it.

> **Branch protection:** the workflow pushes the version-bump commit and tag to the default
> branch, which is ruleset-protected. The `github-actions` bot can't be a ruleset bypass
> actor on a personal (non-org) repo, so the workflow authenticates the push with a
> fine-grained PAT instead. Create one (**Contents: read & write**, this repo only, short
> expiry) and add it as a secret named `RELEASE_PAT` in the `release` environment. It pushes
> as the repo owner (already a bypass actor); without it the run fails fast at the
> *Verify signing secrets* step.

## Installing the iOS IPA

The iOS asset (`switchboard-vX.ipa`) is **unsigned** — there is no Apple Developer account or
App Store path. iOS refuses to run unsigned code, so every install route below re-signs the
app on (or for) your device. Pick whichever your device supports:

- **AltStore / SideStore / Sideloadly** (any non-jailbroken iPhone). These re-sign the IPA
  with your **free Apple ID** on install. The free tier means a **7-day** signature that the
  app auto-refreshes while it can reach a desktop/Wi-Fi pairing (SideStore/AltStore do this in
  the background), and a limit of **3 sideloaded apps** at a time. No paid account needed.
- **TrollStore** (devices vulnerable to the CoreTrust bug — broadly iOS 14.0–16.6.1 and some
  17.0). Installs the unsigned IPA **permanently** (no 7-day refresh, no app limit) by
  fakesigning it on-device. The most convenient route if your device/iOS is in range.
- **Jailbroken devices** can install the IPA directly (e.g. `appinst`).

Because the IPA ships unsigned, the bundled signature is irrelevant — these tools all apply
their own. The build is provenance-attested all the same; verify the **download** the same way
as the APK (next section, swapping `.apk` for the `.ipa`).

> The app is a plain network client (no push, app groups, or associated domains), so it stays
> within free-Apple-ID entitlement limits — nothing extra to configure when sideloading.

## Verifying a release

Three checks are available to anyone who downloads an APK (or IPA), in descending order of strength:

1. **Build provenance (strongest)** — `gh attestation verify <apk> --repo garfiec/Librechat-Mobile
   --signer-workflow garfiec/Librechat-Mobile/.github/workflows/release.yml`. This is the only
   check that resists a *tampered upload*: it's signed by GitHub's CI via Sigstore and can't be
   forged outside the runner. Each release's notes link the run + attestation, but a link is not
   proof — only this command verifies the downloaded bytes. See the README install section. The
   **IPA is attested too** — run the same command with the `.ipa` in place of `<apk>`.
2. **Signing certificate** — `apksigner verify --print-certs <apk>`, compared against the
   published cert SHA-256. Catches a build signed with a different key. **APK only** — the IPA
   ships unsigned (the sideload installer applies its own signature), so there is no fixed iOS
   cert to pin; rely on provenance + checksum for the IPA.
3. **Checksum** — `sha256sum -c <apk>.sha256`. Catches accidental corruption or a download MITM
   only; it does *not* defend against a malicious release (the attacker would control both files).

To confirm an APK really was built at its own tag — the property the tag-before-build fix exists
to guarantee — read `GIT_SHA` out of the shipped dex and compare it to the tagged commit:

```sh
expected=$(git rev-parse --short=8 'v<version>^{commit}')
unzip -p <apk> 'classes*.dex' | strings -n 8 | grep -Fx "$expected"
```

It prints the SHA if the dex carries it and nothing (exit 1) if it does not.

Ask for the expected string rather than listing every hex-looking one: the dex also contains
`0123456789abcdef`, `9223372036854775807` and a couple of BOM artifacts, so an enumerating
pattern leaves you eyeballing a candidate list that grows silently with the codebase. Matching
one fixed string also sidesteps abbreviation length — `--short=8` is a *minimum*, and git
lengthens it when 8 characters are ambiguous (and honours `core.abbrev`), so a hardcoded
`{8}` would miss a 9-character SHA outright.

Two traps in that one line. The `classes*.dex` glob: the app is single-dex today, but it is
R8-minified across ~15 modules and `GIT_SHA` is inlined from `:core:common`, so the first
build to cross 64K methods puts it in `classes2.dex`, and a `classes.dex`-only check would
find nothing and make a good release look unreproducible. And **do not add `-q`**: the system
`grep` may be ugrep (7.5.0 here), whose `-q` exits 1 despite a match when reading from a pipe
— the check would report every release as unreproducible.

**`^{commit}` is required.** Release tags are *annotated*, so a bare `git rev-parse v<version>`
returns the tag-object SHA, which never matches anything in the dex — the check would appear to
fail on a perfectly good release. Read the SHA from the downloaded asset rather than a local
rebuild, or the comparison is circular.

## Distribution channels

- **Obtainium** — tracks GitHub Releases directly (see the README install section). Stable
  releases are full releases; `-rcN` candidate tags are marked pre-release.
- **F-Droid** (future) — developer-signed, verified by reproducible build (`Binaries:` +
  `AllowedAPKSigningKeys`) rather than re-signed with F-Droid's key, because Android refuses
  in-place upgrades across a signing-key change. The proposed recipe and the RFP text are in
  [`fdroid/`](fdroid/). Note `Binaries:` has **no fallback**: a release that fails to reproduce
  is simply never published, so only versions cut after the tag-before-build fix can be listed.

  **Publish the draft promptly once F-Droid is live.** The workflow pushes the tag before it
  creates the release, and the release starts as a draft whose assets 404 anonymously. A scan
  landing in that window sees the new tag, bumps its version, and then fails to fetch the
  reference binary — which surfaces as a `Binaries` download failure and reads like a
  reproducibility problem when it is only an unpublished draft.
- **IzzyOnDroid** (future) — ingests the developer-signed APK and pins the signing key via
  `AllowedAPKSigningKeys`. Use the *same* key. Reproducible builds earn a verification badge.
- **iOS sideloading** — the unsigned `.ipa` is attached to every GitHub Release for
  AltStore / SideStore / Sideloadly / TrollStore installs (see *Installing the iOS IPA*). There
  is no App Store or Obtainium-equivalent auto-update channel; users re-download on each release
  (a SideStore/AltStore source manifest is a possible future follow-up).
