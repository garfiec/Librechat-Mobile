# Store metadata

`metadata/android/en-US/` is the [fastlane metadata layout](https://f-droid.org/docs/All_About_Descriptions_Graphics_and_Screenshots/)
that F-Droid and IzzyOnDroid read for the store listing. Nothing in this directory is
compiled into the app, and there is no fastlane installation — the layout is a convention,
not a tool dependency.

- `short_description.txt` — one line, **80 characters maximum**.
- `full_description.txt` — the listing body. Keep it accurate about what leaves the device;
  it is the first thing an F-Droid reviewer reads against the code.
- `changelogs/next.txt` — **write the changelog here**, when the work lands, not at release
  time. `.github/workflows/release.yml` renames it to `<versionCode>.txt` once the code is known
  and stages it into the release commit, and it **fails the release** if neither file is present.
  Do not hand-name `<versionCode>.txt`: the code is derived from the UTC date at dispatch
  (`2026.08.4` → `20260804`), so a name written in advance goes stale the moment a cut slips into
  the next month — that is how `2026.10.0` shipped with no changelog at all.
  The one exception is an rc train: an `-rcN` and the stable it is promoted to share a
  versionCode, so the candidate's run has already created `<versionCode>.txt` — append any
  further lines **there**, because `next.txt` and `<versionCode>.txt` existing together is an
  ambiguity the workflow refuses to guess at. See `docs/RELEASING.md`.
- `images/icon.png` — the 512x512 listing icon F-Droid's App-inclusion checklist asks for (the
  launcher icon comes from the APK's adaptive icon instead). Generated from the logo master by
  `scripts/make-fdroid-icon.py`; regenerate, do not edit.
- `images/phoneScreenshots/` and `images/tenInchScreenshots/` — sorted by filename, hence the
  numeric prefixes. PNG only.

These directories are the **only** copy of the screenshots they hold: the README links
straight into them rather than keeping its own duplicates, which is why the numeric prefixes
show up in `README.md`. `docs/screenshots/` keeps what the store listing does not carry — the
animated GIFs, and shots that are useful in the README but not worth a store slot.

So when the UI changes: replace the file in whichever directory already holds it, and do not
add a second copy elsewhere. Adding a screenshot to the store listing means moving it here and
repointing the README at the new path, not copying it. Every file under `images/` was once
duplicated in `docs/screenshots/`, which cost 3.2 MB and drifted silently the moment one copy
was refreshed and the other was not.
